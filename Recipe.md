STEPS
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line two muffin pans with paper liners and set aside.
 In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter, oil, and sugar for 2-3 minutes until fluffy.
 Add in the eggs one at a time. Mix for about 30 seconds after each egg addition. Add Greek yogurt, milk, vinegar, food coloring, and vanilla extract and mix until all ingredients are well combined.
 In a separate bowl, sift flour, cornstarch, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt through a strainer and set aside.
 Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in three additions, mixing after each addition.
 Evenly distribute the batter among the lined cupcake pan, filling each one about halfway full.
 Bake for 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the cupcakes from the pan and transfer to a wire rack and cool completely.
 To make the Greek yogurt cream cheese frosting: In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, yogurt, and vanilla extract on medium-high speed until completely smooth.
 Reduce speed to low and slowly add confectioner’s sugar until all is combined.
 Pipe frosting with a piping bag and decorating tip or with a cake spatula. Refrigerate decorated cupcakes until they’re ready to serve.
